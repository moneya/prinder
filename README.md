# PRinder

Speed through pull requests on your repos with an easy to use Tinder-like interface.

## How to use

You'll need a GitHub personal access token. You can get one from [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Paste this, along with the name of the repo you want to work with (e.g. `test-repo`).

During development run `webpack main.js bundle.js --watch` to auto update the bundle.
